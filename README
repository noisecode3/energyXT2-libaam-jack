libaam-jack - JACK Audio & MIDI support for energyXT2 (2.7 32-bit)

This is a qt5 vertion of xt2-config that targets AV linux or debian bullseye. Alsa audio and midi works on arch and will probably be added in as an option. It works in a virtual machine with debian bullseye.

To build this on debian bullseye use

apt install libjack-jackd2-dev:i386 qtbase5-dev:i386

And from fresh install or no build tools you can install.

apt install build-essential git libc6-dev-i386-amd64-cross g++-multilib libjack-jackd2-dev qtbase5-dev

This should be all tell me if I missed anything.

INFORMATION:
--------------------
This is a small library that allows to use JACK Audio & MIDI (Playback and Record) inside energyXT2.
The number of Audio and MIDI channels can be configured using the xt2-config utility.

Initial JACK transport support is available, via 'xt2-trans2midi' utility.
It checks JACK events, and outputs as MIDI CCs in a JACK MIDI port.
Events are:
CC1 - PLAY
CC2 - STOP
CC4 - REW
CC5 - BPM
Set those^ in energyXT, start xt2-trans2midi and connect it to any energyXT MIDI input.

The JACK ports are created as soon as energyXT2 starts and not when a project is loaded (as old libaam.so implementations did).
This allows to more properly integrate energyXT2 into a JACK modular setup, cause all the connections stay open as long as energyXT2 runs.
If you disable an Audio or MIDI port in the energyXT2 settings, the port will not disappear, it will just not be processed.

energyXT2 does not have the option to configure the Audio, so you may want to start xt2-config before starting the main app.
When you change the number of ports, make sure you enable them in energyXT2 Audio or MIDI setup window.


COMPILE:
--------------------
libaam-jack requires JACK; if you have JACK2, I recommend to edit libaam.cpp and set '#define HAVE_JACK2 true'.
It also requires Qt for handle settings and the 'xt2-config' utility.
If you're running a 64bit system, you'll need 32bit binaries of JACK and Qt (energyXT2 is a 32bit only app).
(Note: the xt2-config and xt2-trans2midi utilities do not need to be 32bit)


INSTALL:
--------------------
Just copy the libaam.so file into your energyXT2 folder (replacing the old one).
You can also copy the utilities somewhere you can easily start it ('/usr/local/bin/' is fine).
